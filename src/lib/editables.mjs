// EDITABLE MARKS – the foundation of the "edit on the page" editor.
//
// Every part of a client's site that the owner may change marks itself with data-edit="<kind>"
// (only inside the editor's preview – never on the real website). The editor finds these marks in
// the page and puts the right tool on each one. So a client's editor automatically matches what is
// on THEIR site: if their site uses a slideshow and two photo spots, those three get ✎ buttons.
//
// To make something new editable (e.g. a video): add a kind below, call editMark() in the part that draws it,
// then follow "Adding a new kind" in docs/EDITOR.md (server route + preview merge + DRAFT_SOURCES + KIND_TOOLS panel).
